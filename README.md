# Commands
### Purpose
`commands` is a performant, flexible, future-rich, and easy-to-use command API,
with several ways to implement it into your own programs and/or plugins.

We offer several platforms, and are always aiming to support more. And despite being
written in `kotlin`, we're actively trying to keep it functional when using 
`Java` and other JVM-based languages.

### Documentation
> Note: this is not actively updated, we recommend checking out the [wiki](https://github.com/devrawr/commands/wiki)

### Current State
`commands` is still actively being worked on, and we're planning to add many more features than 
we currently offer. When using `commands`, bugs might occur. We highly recommend reporting bugs 
at the [issues](https://github.com/devrawr/commands/issues) section on the repository.
